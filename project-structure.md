## Directory and File Descriptions

### Root Directory

- **main.py**: Application entry point. Initializes and runs the Flask application.
- **config.py**: Configuration file containing settings like host, port, and debug mode.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python dependencies required by the application.
- **README.md**: Documentation on how to install and use the application.

### `app` Directory

The main application package containing all application code.

- **__init__.py**: Initializes the Flask application and brings together all components.
- **logic.py**: Contains the core business logic of the productivity coach.
- **routes.py**: Defines all application routes and view functions.
- **static**: Directory for static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).
- **templates**: Directory for HTML templates used in the application.

### `__pycache__` Directories

- Generated by Python for storing compiled bytecode for faster loading.
- Should not be manually edited or committed to version control.

## Application Flow

1. The application starts from `main.py`, which imports and runs the Flask application.
2. The Flask application is defined and configured in `app/__init__.py`.
3. Routes in `routes.py` handle HTTP requests and interact with the logic layer.
4. Core functionality is implemented in `logic.py`.
5. Views are rendered using templates from the `templates` directory.
6. Static assets are served from the `static` directory.

## Development Guidelines

- New routes should be added to `routes.py`
- Business logic should be implemented in `logic.py` or in new modules within the `app` package
- Frontend assets should be placed in appropriate directories under `static`
- HTML templates should be placed in the `templates` directory
